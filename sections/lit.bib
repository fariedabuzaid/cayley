  abstract = {A class of edge-labeled graphs called context-free are defined according to their behavior at infinity. Such graphs are generalizations of Cayley graphs of context-free groups. They are also shown to be definable in a very natural way in terms of push-down automata. Using Rabin's theorem on the monadic second-order theory of the finite binary tree, these graphs are also shown to have a decidable monadic second-order theory. Questions about tiling systems and cellular automata operating on these graphs are decidable even when the analogous questions are not, when the systems operate on a two-dimensional grid.},

It is also shown that E-unification is undecidable for variable-permuting theories, thus settling an open problem. The corresponding E-matching problem is shown to be PSPACE-complete.},

We prove that the first-order theory of a string automatic structure of bounded degree is decidable in doubly exponential space (for injective automatic presentations, this holds even uniformly). This result is shown to be optimal since we also present a string automatic structure of bounded degree whose first-order theory is hard for 2EXPSPACE. We prove similar results also for tree automatic structures. These findings close the gaps left open in [28] by improving both the lower and the upper bounds.},

The first one relates rational expressions and a suitable generalization of finite automata. It holds in any monoid or, even better, in the semiring of formal power series on any monoid. It is shown that several classical results in formal language theory, for instance Elgot and Mezei characterization of rational relations by transducers and Chomsky normal form for context-free grammars, can thus be seen as particular cases of this first half of Kleene's theorem.},
